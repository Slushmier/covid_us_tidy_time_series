# covid_us_tidy_time_series
Provides a tidy time-series data set of Covid-19 case data collected by Johns Hopkins University.

I have notice issues with some of the other datasets since some of the US data is at the city/county
level, or at the state level. This dataset aggregates all data to the state/district/territory level
(or for cruise ships where the passengers have not been repatriated yet).

Here's an attempt to provide a tidy, time-series csv of the data posted to Johns Hopkins page at
